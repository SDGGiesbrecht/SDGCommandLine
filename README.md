# SDGCommandLine

SDGCommandLine provides tools for implementing a command line interface.

### Features

- Automatic parsing of options and subcommands
- Automatic `help` subcommand
- Testable output
- Colour formatting tools
    - Automatic `•no‐colour` option
- Interface localization
    - Automatic `set‐language` subcommand to set language preferences.
    - Automatic `•language` option to run in a specific language only once.
- Versioning tools
    - Automatic `version` subcommand
    - Automatic `•use‐version` option to attempt to download and temporarily use a specific version instead of the one which is installed (only for public Swift packages).

### Example Usage

This example creates a tool with the following interface:

```shell
$ parrot speak
Squawk!

$ parrot speak •phrase "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!
```

`main.swift` must consist of the following lines:

```swift
ProcessInfo.applicationIdentifier = "tld.Developper.Parrot"
ProcessInfo.version = Version(1, 0, 0)
ProcessInfo.packageURL = URL(string: "https://website.tld/Parrot")

parrot.executeAsMain()
```

The rest can be anywhere in the project (but putting it in a separate, testable library module is recommended):

```swift
import SDGCommandLine

public let parrot = Command(name: UserFacing<StrictString, MyLocalizations>({ _ in "parrot" }),
                            description: UserFacing<StrictString, MyLocalizations>({ _ in "behaves like a parrot." }),
                            subcommands: [speak])

let speak = Command(name: UserFacing<StrictString, MyLocalizations>({ _ in "speak" }),
                    description: UserFacing<StrictString, MyLocalizations>({ _ in "speaks." }),
                    directArguments: [],
                    options: [phrase],
                    execution: { (_, options: Options, output: Command.Output) throws -> Void in

                        if let specific = options.value(for: phrase) {
                            output.print(specific)
                        } else {
                            output.print("Squawk!")
                        }
})

let phrase = Option<StrictString>(name: UserFacing<StrictString, MyLocalizations>({ _ in "phrase" }),
                                  description: UserFacing<StrictString, MyLocalizations>({ _ in "A custom phrase to speak." }),
                                  type: ArgumentType.string)

enum MyLocalizations : String, InputLocalization {
    case english = "en"
    internal static let cases: [MyLocalizations] = [.english]
    internal static let fallbackLocalization: MyLocalizations = .english
}
```

Tests are easy to set up:

```swift
func testParrot() {
    switch parrot.execute(with: ["speak", "•phrase", "Hello, world!"]) {
    case .success(let output):
        XCTAssertEqual(output, "Hello, world!")
    case .failure:
        XCTFail("The parrot is not co‐operating.")
    }
}
```

## Importing

SDGCommandLine provides libraries for use with the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

Simply add SDGCommandLine as a dependency in `Package.swift` and specify which of the libraries to use:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/SDGGiesbrecht/SDGCommandLine", from: Version(1, 1, 0)),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
            .productItem(name: "SDGCommandLine", package: "SDGCommandLine"),
            .productItem(name: "SDGCommandLineTestUtilities", package: "SDGCommandLine"),
            .productItem(name: "SDGExportedCommandLineInterface", package: "SDGCommandLine"),
        ])
    ]
)
```

The libraries’ modules can then be imported in source files:

```swift
import SDGCommandLine
import SDGCommandLineTestUtilities
import SDGExportedCommandLineInterface
```
