[_Begin Example Usage_]
[_🇨🇦EN_]
This example creates a tool with the following interface:
```shell
 $ parrot speak
 Squawk!

 $ parrot speak •phrase "Hello, world!"
 Hello, world!
```

`main.swift` must consist of the following lines:
[_Example: main.swift 🇨🇦EN_]

The rest can be anywhere in the project
(but putting it in a separate, testable library module is recommended):
[_Example: ParrotLibrary 🇨🇦EN_]

Tests are easy to set up:
[_Example: ParrotTests 🇨🇦EN_]
